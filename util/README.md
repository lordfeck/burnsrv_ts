# Burnsrv Utilities.

## In brief:

Note (05/04/2020): `testcfg` is deprecated. The intention was it could be configured to run multiple tests overnight. It is possible that it could be revived later.

`burnsrv_setup` contains everything needed to install a streaming server. It also contains some scripts to run streams using ffmpeg.

`makempeg` contains scripts that will generate a number of sample files in the required formats.

`slogger` contains the perl scripts to take tcpdump files and analyse them.
