## About mathlib/
An experimental maths library written in pure C. Initially I thought to use it for
functfun but later settled for math.h. However time wasn't wasted as it served an
oppertunity to refresh my C knowledge.

**Usage:** run `make` then `./mathtest`

**Features**
* Euler's Number
* Natural Logs
* Exponential Function

See `mathops.h` for all implemented operations. Integer and double ops are
supported.
